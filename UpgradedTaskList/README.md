Visual Studio Task List Add-On To Filter Tasks

This is essentially an upgrade to the in-built Task List window on Visual Studio.

Currently the project is designed to work on Visual Studio 2010, but I have plans to make a compatible version for Visual Studio 2013 when it's all finished.

This project takes the comment blocks such as //TODO or 'HACK (depending on what language you use) and adds the following features
  - Filter on Project Scope (Class, Project or Solution)
  - Filter on Token (i.e. TODO or HACK)
  - Add a comment token
  - Remove a comment token (except for the default values TODO, HACK and UNDONE)
  
The goal is to make the task list into a useful feature of Visual Studio
